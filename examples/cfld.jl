"""
Two-player Competitive Facility Location and Design (CFLD) problem.

Based on Crönert and Minner (2024). For futher details, see Section 3.2 of:
    [*T. Crönert, S. Minner, "Equilibrium Identification and Selection in Finite Games". 2024. Operations Research*](https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2022.2413)

Note that the players have *nonlinear* payoffs, which SGM can handle because this is a
two-player game. In other words, the polymatrix can still be computed for the sampled games.

# Notes
- SCIP can be replaced with other solvers, such as Gurobi or CPLEX.
